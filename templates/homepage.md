### Introduction: 
Urban heat is the phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures than less urbanized areas due to the built environment, human activity, and air pollution. Heat is the #1 weather-related killer and the proportion of the human population living in urban areas is projected to increase to 70% by 2050, making urban heat resilience action an imperative. Explore this map to see where heat mitigation and adaptation action should be prioritized.


### What are the impacts of urban heat and how will that evolve in the future?
* Projected costs due to extreme heat events on the economy, health, infrastructure, energy and water demand, biodiversity, etc.
* Widening socioeconomic disparities and comorbidities with air pollution, etc.
* Intensified and more frequent heat waves due to climate change
* Urban/extreme heat is significant enough to warrant not being sidelined or lumped in with other climate action/priorities but addressed by itself

### What actions are cities taking (as a whole in the US)?
* Heat mapping campaigns (NOAA Heat Watch) or satellite data to map heat risk/temperature
* Engaging with communities and analyzing demographics to understand heat risk
* Creating heat action plans or incorporating heat action into climate plans
* Partnering with local organizations and universities to power solutions and research

### What is still needed for resilience to match the heat?
* A 2022 study of US municipal plans found that heat is a growing concern but solid action is still underwhelming - need stronger "heat governance" (source: MDPI)
*Offset costs and time for cities to take action:
* Partner with local organizations already doing something similar (e.g., planting trees)
* Cities should go for low-cost high-impact solutions relevant to their needs (pros/cons of common heat solutions)
* Education/upskilling the workforce (Arsht-Rock heat platform for city officials; may also need training for implementing solutions such as selecting plants for urban greening)
*Metrics, reports, and dashboards to track metrics and provide solid data on how effectively resources are being spent on heat action that makes a difference:
* Some cities have "climate smart" dashboards or reports which update progress on solutions; the same should be done for heat resilience solutions
* This will also help build a business case for investing in heat resilience (justify budgeting) as well as bolster confidence and understanding of what solutions are most effective for what cities with specific needs
