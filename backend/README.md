# urban-heat-resilience
A website for the Urban Heat Resilience capstone project from Climatebase fellowship cohort 6.
This map will be developed utilizing Python and mapping data to create a website where users can view live map information about urban heat zones in their area and ways to mitigate extreme heat.
As climate change continues to bring record temperatures across the globe, cities are often most hardest hit with temperature spikes.
These spikes can often lead to grid overloads causing black or brown outs, severe heat stroke or death in children, the elderly, or people susceptible to high heat. While cities are beginning to tackle this particular challenge of climate change, mapping of what exact locations are most at risk in cities has been lacking.
This project aims to showcase the areas of greatest concern in a city and enable politicians, city planners, and every day citizens where exactly should be the areas of greatest concern and be able to fix these problems with either nature based solutions or infrastructure updates that can help cities stay cool, and thus, reducing additional reliance on air conditioning and other greenhouse gas emitting cooling solutions.
The project is part of ClimateBase's Cohort 6 Fellowship, which can be viewed in more detail at https://climatebase.org/fellowship
